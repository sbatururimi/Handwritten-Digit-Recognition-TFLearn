# Overview
Handwritten digit recognition with TFLearn. Using the [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) dataset, which contains images of handwitten single digits and their respective lavels (numbers from 0 to 9), we train a neuronal network that recognizes handwritten digits.

## Dependencies
* Download anaconda
```
conda create -n tflearn python=3.5
```

* Activate the source
```
source activate tflearn
```
* Ensure you have numpy, jupyter notebook, matplotlib and pandas.
```
conda install numpy pandas jupyter notebook matplotlib
```
* Run the following to open up the notebook:
```
jupyter notebook Handwritten\ Digit\ Recognition\ with\ TFLearn.ipynb
```

## Take a look
You can open the jupyter notebook directly in github
